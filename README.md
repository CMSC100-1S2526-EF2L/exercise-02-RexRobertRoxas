## Steps
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Create an index.html file. This will be the main HTML that will be opened whenever the GitHub Page is opened.
3. Edit the html files, and add other necessary files such as CSS Stylesheets and JavaScript scripts.
4. Push the local repository to GitHub.
5. In Setttings, go to General. Go to the bottom of the page and set the repository's visibility to public.
6. Go to Settings>Pages, then set the branch to be deployed to where the working index.html is. Save the setting.
7. Refresh the page and visit the GitHub Page URL.

## Key Takeaways
My main takeaways from this exercise is the usefulness of flexboxes, as it makes it easier to layout the elements in a grid-like manner. Another main takeaway is that GitHub Pages is a good way to publish pages, especially for providing documentation or information about your repository.
